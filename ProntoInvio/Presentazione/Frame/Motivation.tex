\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communications are becoming ever more important and widespread.
        \item Classical physics is only a special case of quantum physics.
        \item The use of quantum non-Gaussian states can significantly improve the performance 
                of a communication system.
    \end{itemize}
