\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can design a quantum equivalent of a classical communication system.
        \item The use of PACSs or PASS improves the performance of the 
                quantum state discriminator for QOOK systems.
        \item The use of PASSs in particular can leads to significant benefits in terms of
                MDEP.
    \end{itemize}
