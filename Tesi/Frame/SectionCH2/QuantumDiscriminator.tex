\section{Quantum Discriminator}
    The problem of quantum state discrimination (QSD) are one of the most important
    aspect of quantum communication. As in classical communication, the ability to 
    distinguish between two or more states, in presence of noise, can be decisive for improve
    the performance of the communication system. Unlike the classical situation however,
    the discrimination can be done using a custom-designed quantum discriminator, overcoming
    the classical physics limits.

    \subsection{Binary quantum state discrimination}
    \begin{figure}[ht]

            \label{fig:2.2}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    The problem of discrimination between two quantum states is realized, as every measurement
    process \ref{post:2}, using an operator or with a set of operators.
    If the state of system is unknown, as shown in figure \ref{fig:2.2}, there are two hypotheses
    about the state $\pmb{\Xi}$ (the problem is generalises easly for $M$ different states),
    given by:
    \begin{equation}\begin{split}
        H_0 : \pmb{\Xi}=\pmb{\Xi}_0\\
        H_1 : \pmb{\Xi}=\pmb{\Xi}_1
        \label{eq:binHyp}
    \end{split}\end{equation}
    It is necessary a set of two positive-definites operator (POVM):
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{P}=\{\pmb{\Pi}_0,\pmb{\Pi}_1\}
    \end{equation}
    for the discrimination process and the probability that the hypothesis $H_j$ is choosen
    if $H_k$ is the right choose, is given by \cite{tesiGuerrini}:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbb{P}\{H_j|H_k\}=tr\{\pmb{\Xi}_k\pmb{\Pi}_j\}.
    \end{equation}
    The error probability in the discrimination process, if $p_0$ and $p_1$ are respectively 
    the probabilty of symbols $0$ and $1$, is so given by
    \begin{equation}
        P_e=1-\left(p_0 tr\{\pmb{\Xi}_0\pmb{\Pi}_0\}+p_1 tr\{\pmb{\Xi}_0\pmb{\Pi}_0\}\right).
    \end{equation}
