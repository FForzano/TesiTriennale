## Abstract
Quantum information science is opening doors to new technologies for the elaboration and
the transmission of the informations. Those technologies are based on some peculiarities of
the quantum mechanics such as the superposition, the entanglement and the indeterminancy
principle. The ability to handle quantum mechanic properties will lead, in the foreseeable future,
to design and implement innovative technologies. That is a very significant fact if we consider
the increasingly computerization and necessity to be connected in our society. Communication
will play a key role in this scenario, so it is essential to study and optimize an efficient and
reliable quantum communication system.
In this thesis are analyzed quantum communication systems based on non-classical and non-
Gaussian states. In particulare we study systems with on-off keying (OOK) binary modulation
and binary phase-shifting keying modulation in presence of the thermal noise. This study
highlights how the use of PACSs and PASSs improves the performance.
