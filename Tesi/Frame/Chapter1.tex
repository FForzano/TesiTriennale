\chapter{Quantum Mechanics Abstract}
    In this chapter, a brief overview of quantum mechanics postulates,
    of the notation and of the essential concept used in this thesis is given. 
    The target of that is to explain to the reader the essential concept, in 
    order to give him the possibility to understand the obtained result.
