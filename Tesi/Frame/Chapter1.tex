\chapter{Quantum Mechanics Abstract}
    In this chapter, a bief overview of quantum mechanics postulates and
    of the notation used in this thesis is given. The target of that is 
    to explain to the reader the essential concept [...]

    \section{Postulates}
        Like every phisics theory, quantum mechanics is builded from few 
        essential postulates.
        In this section are briefly introduced the six Dirac-Von Newman 
        postulates of Quantum Mechanics \cite{quantumMec_Dirac}\cite{quantumMec_Neumann}.
        
        \subsection{First Postulate}
        \begin{postulate}[State Representation]
            The state of an isolated quantum system is represented by a complex unitary 
            vector in an Hilbert space:
            \begin{equation*}
                \ket{\psi} \in \Hilbert
            \end{equation*}
            The space of possible states of the system is called state space and is a
            separable complex Hilbert space.
            \label{post:1}
        \end{postulate}
        \begin{observation*}
            Differently to the classical physics, in quantum mechanics the concept
            of state of system is introduced. In classical mechanics a system is 
            described by his observables, like position or four-wheeled.
        \end{observation*}
        
        \subsection{Second Postulate}
        \begin{postulate}[Observables]
            Every observables of the system is represented by an Hermitian operator
            acting on the state space:
            \begin{equation*}
                \mathcal{M}:\Hilbert\to\Hilbert
            \end{equation*}
            The outcomes of the measurement can only be one of the eigenvalue of the 
            operator $\mathcal{M}$.
            \label{post:2}
        \end{postulate}
        \begin{observation*}
            The possible outcomes of the measurement are real number because $\mathcal{M}$
            is self-andjoint. 
        \end{observation*}

        \subsection{Third Postulate}
        \begin{postulate}[Born's Rule]
            The probability to get the measurement $\lambda_i$ from the observable 
            $\mathcal{M}$ in the system in state $\ket{\psi}$ is:
            \begin{equation*}
                %\mathbb{P}(\lambda_i)=\braket{\psi}{\lambda_i}\braket{\lambda_i}{\psi}
                \mathbb{P}(\lambda_i)=\bra{\psi}\mathcal{P}_i\ket{\psi}
            \end{equation*}
            where $\bra{\psi}$ is the correspondent vector of $\ket{\psi}$ in the 
            dual space of $\Hilbert$ and where $\mathcal{P}_i$ is the projection operator
            of $\lambda_i$ in the correspondent space.
            \label{post:3}
        \end{postulate}

        \subsection{Fourth Postulate}
        \begin{postulate}[Wavefunction Collapse]
            The state after measurement of $\lambda_i$ is $\mathcal{P}_i\ket{\psi}$ (with the
            necessary normalization):
            \begin{equation*}
                \ket{\psi'}=\frac{\mathcal{P}_i\ket{\psi}}{\bra{\psi}\mathcal{P}_i\ket{\psi}}.
            \end{equation*}
            \label{post:4}
        \end{postulate}

        \subsection{Fifth Postulate}
        \begin{postulate}[Time Evolution]
            The time evolution of an isolated quantum system is given by an unitary operator
            $\mathcal{U}$:
            \begin{equation*}
                \ket{\psi(t)}=\mathcal{U}(t_0,t)\ket{\psi(t_0)}.
            \end{equation*}
            \label{post:5}
        \end{postulate}
        \begin{observation*}[Time dependent Shrodinger Equation]
            From postulate \ref{post:5}, is possible to found the time dependent Shrodinger Equation:
            \begin{equation*}
                i\hbar\derivative{\ket{\psi(t)}}{t}=H(t)\ket{\psi(t)}
            \end{equation*}
            where $H(t)$ is the Hemiltonian matrix.
        \end{observation*}

        \subsection{Sixth Postulate}
        \begin{postulate}[Composite System]
            The state space of a system composite from $\Hilbert_1$ and $\Hilbert_2$ is given by
            \begin{equation*}
                \Hilbert=\Hilbert_1\otimes\Hilbert_2.
            \end{equation*}
        \end{postulate}
