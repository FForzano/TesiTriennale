    A quantum communication system can be described similarly to a classical one, as we can 
    see in figure \ref{fig:3.0}. An information source emits a flow symbols $\msf{a} \in \mathcal{A}$, this
    can be considered, without loss of generality, as a flow of bits. These bits have to be 
    modulated with a quantum modulator that emits on the communication channel a quantum state
    $\Operator{\sXi} \in \mathcal{A}_p$ for each bit or group of bits. The channel can distort the
    state and deliver the state $\Operator{\sUpsilon} \in \mathcal{B}_p$ that is in general 
    different from $\Operator{\sXi}$.
    The receiver have to recognize the information $\msf{\hat{a}}$ as well as possible, i.e. with 
    the minimum possible error probability.
