\section{QEF States}
    In this section, some quantum states of electromagnetic field useful for quantum 
    communication are characterized. A brief introduction to another one tool for the 
    description of quantum systems is initially given, so some Gaussian and 
    non-Gaussian states are characterized.

    \subsection{Phase-space description}
        As seen before, in \ref{eq:QEF.4}, quantum system can be completely
        described by a density operator $\Xi$ defined in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
        $\Hilbert$. This operator can be expressed by the Fock representation (\ref{def:3}).

        Sometimes, however, it is convenient to give another representation of state $\Xi$ by
        means of a complex function introduced by Wigner \cite{Wigner}: the quasi-probability 
        distribution. In this thesis, this representation will be introduced and it will be used to
        classify the possible states.
