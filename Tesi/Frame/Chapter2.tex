\chapter{Quantum Communication}
    Quantum mechanics is allowing to overcome the limits of classical comunication systems. In 
    the last decades the research in this field is leading to very intresting results that could 
    be significantly improves the performance of communication systems. In this chapter, a brief
    overview of quantum communication tools is given: in first section the equivalents
    of classical modulation for quantum communication systems is presented; in the second section 
    the concept of quantum states discriminator (QSD) is given and the optimal QSD are presented.
