\section{PACS Discrimination}
    The effect of the use of PACS in an OOK communication system was extensively discussed in
    \cite{PACSDisc}. In this section the most important result will be reported and a BPSK
    system will be tested.

    \subsection{Quantum OOK PACS system}
    The use of PACS in an OOK system can significantly improve the performance. The MDEP, with
    thermal noise, is given by the Helstrom bound \ref{eq:HelstromBound}, where, for an OOK PACS
    system,
    \begin{equation}
        \pmb{\Xi}_0 =  \pmb{\Xi}_{th} = \pmb{\Xi}_{th}^{(0)}(0)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation*}
        \pmb{\Xi}_1 =  \pmb{\Xi}_{th}^{(k)}(\mu).
    \end{equation*}
    It is useful, in order to evaluate the performance of the system, to introduce the mean number
    of photon $n_p$ in a quantum state $\pmb{\Xi}$, which is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        n_p = tr\{\pmb{\Xi}\pmb{A}^\dagger\pmb{A}\}.
        \label{eq:genericnp}
    \end{equation}
    For a photon added coherent state, the equation \ref{eq:genericnp} becomes \cite{PACSDisc}:
    \begin{equation}
        n_p(\mu,\bar{n}) = \frac{N_{k+1}(\mu,\bar{n})}{N_k(\mu,\bar{n})}-1,
        \label{eq:np}
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation}
        N_k(\mu,\bar{n}) = tr\{(\pmb{A}^\dagger)^k \pmb{\Xi}_{th}(\mu) \pmb{A}^k\}.
    \end{equation}
    It is possible to observe that the minimum of $n_p$ is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        n_p(0,\bar{n}) = (k+1)(\bar{n}+1)-1.
        \label{eq:min_np}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{figure}[tbp]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig3.1.pdf}
            \caption{MDEP for PACS QOOK with: $k=0,1,2,3$; $\bar{n}=10^{-2}$; $p_0=p_1=1/2$}
            \label{fig:3.1}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    The MDEP of a quantum OOK system with PACS in function of $n_p$ is represented in the figure
    \ref{fig:3.1}, where in the x-axis there are the mean number of photon $n_p$ in the state 
    $\pmb{\Xi}_1$ (which corresponds to the mean number of photon in the whole system) and in the 
    y-axes there are the MDEP ($P_e$). The plot was obtained for equiprobable symbols and 
    mean number of thermal photons $\bar{n}=10^{-2}$.  
    The argument of the trace norm $\norm{\cdot}_1$ in the Helstrom bound 
    \ref{eq:HelstromBound}, is an operator in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space; for the 
    simulation, it has been approximated in $N=30$ dimension.
    We can observe that the photon addition improves significantly the performance in terms
    of error probability. Incrasing the value of the parameter $k$ the MDEP of the system 
    transate, the error probability, for the same energy-level, is lower if $k$ is bigger.
    We can notice too that the graphs do not start all from $0$. This is because the minimum
    mean number of photons in a photon added state is not always $0$ as it possible to see in 
    equation \ref{eq:min_np}.  

    \subsection{Quantum BPSK PACS system}
    It can be interesting to assess the effect of photon addition in a quantum BPSK system.
    The constellation is given, for a PACS BPSK, by:
    \begin{equation}
        \pmb{\Xi}_0 =  \pmb{\Xi}_{th} = \pmb{\Xi}_{th}^{(k)}(-\mu)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation*}
        \pmb{\Xi}_1 =  \pmb{\Xi}_{th}^{(k)}(\mu).
    \end{equation*}
    %
    In absence of noise ($\bar{n}=0$), the MDEP is given by formula \ref{eq:HelstromBPure} where
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            &\ket{\psi_0}=\ket{-\mu^{(k)}},\\
            &\ket{\psi_1}=\ket{\mu^{(k)}}.
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    %
    The inner product is given, in closed form, by \cite{PACSDisc}:
    \begin{equation}
        \braket{-\mu^{(k)}}{\mu^{(k)}} = \frac{L_k(\absolutevalue{\mu}^2)}{L_k(-\absolutevalue{\mu}^2)}
        e^{-2\absolutevalue{\mu}^2},
        \label{eq:innerp_nonNoise}
    \end{equation}
    where $L_k(x)$ is the Laguerre polynomial of parameter $k$, evaluate in $x$.
    \begin{figure}[tbp]
        \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig3.2a.pdf}
            \caption{$k=1$}
        \end{subfigure}
        %\hspace*{fill}
        \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig3.2b.pdf}
            \caption{$k=2$}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{MDEP of quantum BPSK in absence of noise, $N=30$.}
        \label{fig:3.2}
    \end{figure}
    In figure \ref{fig:3.2} the MDEP in absence of noise, for QBPSK with PACS, is plotted for
    $k=1$ and for $k=2$, in function of $n_p$, with $N=30$. It can be noticed that exist $k$ zeros
    in the MDEP plot, where $k$ is the number of photon additions, that corresponds to the zeros
    of $L_k(\absolutevalue{\mu}^2)$ in equation \ref{eq:innerp_nonNoise}.
    The existence of these zeros is not really useful for the design of a quantum communication
    system because their selectivity factors are too high for a phisical implementation. It is, 
    nevertheless, possible to use that in order to evaluate the effect of the thermal noise.
    \begin{figure}[tbp]
        \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig3.3a.pdf}
            \caption{$k=1$ \& $\mu = 0.54$}
        \end{subfigure}
        %\hspace*{fill}
        \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig3.3b.pdf}
            \caption{$k=2$ \& $\mu = 1.58$}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Thermal noise effect, in corrispondence of MDEP zeros ($N=40$).}
        \label{fig:3.3}
    \end{figure}
    In figure \ref{fig:3.3}, the sluggish performance due to the thermal noise is clear. The plot
    shows the trend of MDEP, for zeros value of $\mu$, in function of $\bar{n}$; the used approximation
    is $N=30$. The MDEP in presence of noise is given using the expression \ref{eq:HelstromBound}.
    We can shown using the formula \ref{eq:nbar} that $\bar{n}$ in a real cases in near to zero, the 
    plot show the general trend of the MDEP.

    \begin{figure}[tbp]
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fig3.4.pdf}
        \caption{BPSK and OOK comparison. \\$N=45$, $\bar{n}=10^{-2}$, $p_0=p_1=1/2$}
        \label{fig:3.4}
    \end{figure}
    The comparison between a quantum OOK system and a quantum BPSK system is given in figure 
    \ref{fig:3.4}, in function of the mean number of photons in the system $\bar{E}$, that is equal to
    $n_p$ for the OOK system and the sum of the $n_p$ for each state for the BPSK system.
    The plots are given with $\bar{n}= 10^{-2}$, $N=45$ and equiprobable symbols.
    The obtained result is really intresting: the quantum BPSK has a sluggish performance due two 
    the photon addition process. At an equal level of energy $\bar{E}$, for PACS systems, it is
    possible to find an OOK configuration that maximizes the performance.
