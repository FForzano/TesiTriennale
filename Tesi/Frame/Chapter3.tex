\chapter{Discrimination of Photon Added States}
    In this chapter, two tipe system with photon added states are characterized in term of
    their discrimination MDEP \ref{eq:HelstromBound}: a photon added coherent state system 
    (from \cite{PACSDisc})and a photon added squeezed state. For each system the OOK
    configuration and the BPSK will be considered. 
    The use of photon added states, as it will be shown, can improve significatly the performance
    of the communication. 
    
    The analyzed situation do not consider the channel effect on the trasmitted information, it was
    supposed that the noisy states reach the discriminator as it was created. The channel effects
    for a PACS system are described in \cite{PACSDisc}.
